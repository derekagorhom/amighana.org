                            <p>The african Maths Initiative will be a unique opportunity for Students in Ghana to have their eyes opened to the world of mathematics and advance technology. 
                            </p>
                                                    
                            <p>AMI Ghana wants to develop a positive mathematical culture within the African continent. Through the Allotey Maths Camp, a one-week residential programme for SHS students, 
                                we showcase the practical and fun side of mathematics using ideas from programming to code breaking to modelling nature. Students eyes are opened up to the power, importance and fun of mathematics, 
                                completely changing their attitude from a fear to a love and enjoyment of mathematics. At the Allotely Maths Camp,
                                 everybody learns, with both international and local volunteers coming together every year to brainstorm new activities, puzzles and games to excite and engage students.
                                After successfully running maths camps for six years, our Maths Clubs initiative is taking these ideas directly into schools, scaling up our activities, aiming to eventually reach all students in Ghana.</p>
                                
                               <p> AMI Ghana's overriding objective is to support the improvement of education
                                and other scientific developmental projects, through the development of a positive mathematical culture and research initiatives
                                at all academic levels within Ghana and the rest of the African continent. 
                                
                                AMI Ghana will be involved in a variety of projects and initiaves related to
                                one or more of the objectives:</p>
                                
                                <p>1. Bring the latest mathematical knowledge and teaching methods to africa</p>
                               <p> 2. Popularise mathematics to dispel the myth that maths is hard. </p>
                               <p> 3. increase general access to scientific knowledge and education through mathematical initives. </p>
                                <p>4. collaborate with educational institutions and organisations to advise on mathematics curriculum
                                development and ICT integration at all academic levels.

                            <p><b>Why a Maths Camp?</b></p>
                            <p> The top 15 highest- earning college degrees (in the US) all have one thing in common - maths skills - (US) National Association of Colleges and Employers "Maths is at the crux of who get paid, 
                                if you have those skills, you are an extremely valuable asset. 
                                we don't generate enough people like that in this country. (US)" Ed koc, director of research at NACE, (US National Association of Colleges and Employers).
                                </p>
                                
                            <p>As Ghana develops its economy one of the key skills that can lead to leapfrogging is the use of mathematical talent. 
                                this is already appening in Asia where they are getting the top maths grades. Nathematics teaches you to be a logical thinnker, a problem solver and a methodical and detailed worker. these broad skills are vital for almost any job or challenge a student will face after their studies. 
                                Doing well in mathematics will be the best preparation for their working life, regardless of what they decide to do.</p>
